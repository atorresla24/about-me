        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Alec Torres (he/him) and I live in Spotsylvania, Virginia (EST). I have recently moved to Virginia after leaving Stony Brook University in New York to pursue something different more my pace and style and thought code fellows would be the best option. My operating system is Windows 11. I am excited for this class because it is the start of something new for me and something I am intrigued in pursuing.

          I graduated high school in 2020 from North Babylon High School and have some college experience froom when I attended Suffolk Community College during high school. I also have a deeper partial college experience from when I attended Stony Brook University.

        <h4>Goals:</h4>
      </li>

        <p>
          My life goals are pretty complex in what I want to do but to simplify the beginning I want to graduate from Code Fellows and become a full fledged software developer. I would even come back and take the cyber-security courses to expand my skillset. Graduating from Code Fellows would allow me to create a foundation for myself that would help me be able to continue with the rest of plans I have in life.
